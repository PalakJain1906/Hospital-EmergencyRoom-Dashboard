# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## 👋 Welcome
This project is built around a simple but important question:  
**What’s really happening inside a busy hospital emergency room?**

Using Excel and a dataset of 493 patient records from October, I created a dashboard that helps 
visualize daily patient flow, wait times, satisfaction scores, and admission patterns. It’s designed to give hospital teams — or anyone curious — a clearer picture of how patients move through the ER and where improvements might be needed.

## 📊 What the Data Tells Us
- **Busy Days:** Oct 18 had the highest patient count (25), while Oct 8, 15, and 27 were the quietest (10 patients each).
- **Wait Times:** Patients waited an average of ~35 minutes. Some days spiked above 40 minutes — a red flag for staffing or process delays.
- **Satisfaction Scores:** The average score was 4.74/10. Drops on Oct 3 and Oct 30 suggest those days were especially tough.
- **Admissions:** Nearly half of the patients were admitted (48.5%), while the rest were treated and discharged.
- **Demographics:** Most patients were aged 60+, with the 70–79 group showing the highest ER demand.
- **Gender Balance:** Almost equal — 248 female and 245 male patients.
- **Referrals:** 282 patients came without any referral. Among those referred, General Practice and Orthopedics were the top sources.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
- **Daily Patient Count:** Tracks inflow to spot peak days and plan resources.
- **Wait Time Trend:** Area sparkline shows delays and helps flag days needing attention.
- **Satisfaction Score Trend:** Visualizes patient experience and links it to busy periods.
- **Admission Status:** Pie chart shows admitted vs. not admitted.
- **Demographic Breakdown:** Age and gender charts help tailor services.
- **Referral Sources:** Reveals which departments are sending patients.

## 💡 Why This Matters
Emergency rooms are fast-paced and unpredictable. This dashboard helps hospital teams:
- Spot operational bottlenecks  
- Improve patient flow and satisfaction  
- Allocate resources more effectively  
- Understand who their patients are — and what they need


## 🚀 What’s Next
- Automate dashboard updates with **Power BI**  
- Add predictive modeling for **patient inflow forecasting**  
- Expand analysis to include **staffing levels vs. patient load**
